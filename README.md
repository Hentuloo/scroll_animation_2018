# scroll_animation_2018

>I share this project available only to show my learning path.

It is my project where i learned: "how work scroll"

## What i would do beter today:(i did this project in 2018)
- make avaiable for small devices
- correct alt in img
- animation only use opacity/transform
- ES6
- html5
- navigation should be in "nav ul>li" and with some hidden titles
- styles, javascript and images in different files/folders
- images should be dynamic for different screens
